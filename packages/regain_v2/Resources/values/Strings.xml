      We advise that you always start with a short warm-up before you start each exercise. If you are unable to stand while holding onto a support then this program is not suitable for you. Please ensure that these exercises are conducted in a safe and controlled environment. You should be able to perform these exercises without help from anyone. However, you may prefer to have someone else present to observe, ensure your safety and to provide encouragement.

      All of these exercises can be modified if you wish, by holding the back of a chair or using a wall for support. Make sure the chair is strong and in proper repair, so that it can support your weight. Position the chair on a flat surface. Ensure there is ample room around the chair so that you cannot hit anything during the exercise. If you are using a wheelchair, make sure the brakes are locked on before commencing. If you feel stable enough you can remove your armrests and/or footplates to allow more freedom of movement.

      You are advised to discontinue or modify any exercise that causes pain. Only move as far as you can comfortably move. If you normally experience pain when moving you may modify these exercises to avoid such pain. Wear comfortable clothing to ensure maximum movement during exercises. Wear suitable footwear with a rubber or other solid sole.

      You should be able to speak in your normal voice and tone during your exercise sessions, If you are out of breath and unable to speak normally, then lower the intensity level by slowing down the exercise or taking a rest. As with any exercise program, if at any point you begin to feel faint, dizzy or have physical discomfort, you should stop immediately and consult a health professional.
